# CRM Redesign - Final Implementation âœ…

## What Was Done

### âœ… 1. Installed Official Shadcn Kanban Component
- Installed `tunnel-rat` dependency required for the kanban
- Created `/src/components/ui/kanban.tsx` with the official shadcn kanban implementation
- Full drag-and-drop functionality with accessibility announcements
- TypeScript-first with proper types

### âœ… 2. Created New Campaign Kanban
**File**: `/src/pages/crm/components/ShadcnCampaignKanban.tsx`

**Features**:
- Uses official shadcn kanban component (proper implementation)
- Value-based colored accent bars (green for $100k+, blue for $50k+, gray for less)
- Days in stage indicator
- Modern card design with proper spacing
- Entity icons for PF (person) vs PJ (company)
- Smooth drag-and-drop between status columns
- Column totals showing campaign count and total value
- Proper TypeScript types for all data

### âœ… 3. Removed Pipeline Chart
- Deleted the unused pipeline funnel chart (you didn't want it)
- Kept only the Win Rate gauge
- Cleaner, more focused campaign overview

### âœ… 4. Enhanced Entity Cards (Clients, Artists, Brands)
**Major improvements**:
- **Gradient accent bars** at the top (colored per entity type)
  - Clients: Blue-to-cyan gradient
  - Artists: Purple-to-pink gradient
  - Brands: Amber-to-orange gradient
- **Larger avatars** (14x14 instead of 12x12) for better visibility
- **Hover effects**: Cards lift up with `-translate-y-1` and show shadow-xl
- **Border highlight**: 2px borders that turn primary color on hover
- **Company indicator**: Small building icon for PJ (legal entity) type clients
- **Gradient overlays**: Subtle gradient appears from bottom on hover
- **Better typography**: Bold font for names, proper text hierarchy
- **Contact count badges**: More readable with icons and better styling

### âœ… 5. Updated Main CRM Page
**File**: `/src/pages/CRM.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Replaced `ModernCampaignKanban` with `ShadcnCampaignKanban`
- Removed pipeline chart and related data processing
- Improved entity card designs across all tabs
- Cleaner imports (removed unused components)
- Better grid layouts for insights + win rate
